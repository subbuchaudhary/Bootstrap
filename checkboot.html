The human being is part of the primate group that walks on two legs rather than than the usual four like most of the other primates, which is known as bipedal. The thing that sets human beings apart from other primates however, is the fact the human has a highly developed brain and therefore capable of abstract reasoning, language and problem solving.
The modern human being is thought to have originated in Eastern Africa around 200,000 years ago and due to the advanced mental capacity of the human and the fact that humans have been able to use their two free arms to manipulate objects, has meant that human beings are more sophisticated in using tools than any other species of animal.

The human population on Earth is thought to be exceeding 6.8 billion human individuals, a number which seems to be continuously growing year by year. Today there are large populations of human on every continent on Earth with the exception of Antarctica, a continent so cold and desolate that only a handful of the animal species actually exist there.

Like many other species of primate humans are highly sociable animals and are able interact with one another through spoken language, gestures and written language. Humans have developed extremely complex social structures that have meant that the human population is linked together through a series of interlinking groups and organisations.

The social interactions amongst the human race has today means that there is a wide variety of traditions, rituals, ethics and laws which together form the foundations of modern society. The human appreciation for aesthetic beauty has led to the development in art, literature, music and writing.

Humans are particularly well known for their desire to acquire knowledge about and find the answers to complex questions about the world around them. This level of curiosity has led to the advancement in tools and skills, as humans are the only species of animal known to build fires, cook food, make clothes and develop technologies. Human beings pass these vital success skills down through the generations by using education.

The eagle is a (generally) large sized bird of prey meaning that the eagle is one of the most dominant predators in the sky. Eagles are most commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere including Europe, Asia and North America. Eagles are also found on the African continent.
There are more than 60 different species of eagle in the world with only 2 of these eagle species being found in the USA and Canada. However, one of these eagle species is one of the most common species of eagle, the bald eagle. Despite it's name the bald eagle has a full head of feathers but their bright white colour makes the bald eagle very distinguishable. The golden eagle is the only other species of eagle found on the American continent.

The size of an eagle is dependent on the species of eagle. Eagles can range in size from 40cm to over 1m in height. The wing span of an eagle tends to be at least double the length of the eagle's body. Eagles have feathers on the ends of their wings which the eagles move up and down to help them when flying.

Eagles are dominant predators and are known as birds of prey. Eagles feed off smaller birds and bats in the sky and small mammals and fish on the ground. The eagle is well known for it's incredible eyesight. An eagle's eyesight is so good that an eagle can apparently see a mouse on the ground when the eagle is still high in the sky.

The eagle is used as a symbol in many national flags and emblems all around the world, as an eagle is believed to resemble power or good fortune. Eagles are dominant and ruthless predators in their environment and eagles therefore have very few natural predators themselves. Eagles are most likely to be hunted by smaller animals when they are chicks or still young and inexperienced so they are fairly vulnerable.

Female eagles build their nests in tall tree tops or on high cliffs where they are at their safest. The mother eagle tends to lay two eggs, which hatch after about a month. In many eagle species however, one of the eagle chicks is naturally slightly stronger than the other chick, with the stronger chick generally killing it's weaker sibling.

Eagles have adapted well to their dominant predatory lifestyle. Not only do eagles have exceptional eyesight and are about to soar remarkably quickly through the air for such a large bird, but eagles also have pointed beaks and agile feet known as talons. The beak of the eagle is perfectly designed for ripping flesh away from bone, and the talons of the eagle are so strong that the eagle is able to carry it's prey in it's feet until it reaches a safe place to eat it.

The Lion is one of the largest, strongest and powerful felines in the world second only in size to the Siberian Tiger. They are the largest cats on the African continent and are unique among felines in a number of ways but the biggest difference between Lions and other cats is that they are incredibly sociable animals that live together in family groups known as prides. Lions are also part of the big cat family meaning that both males and females are able to roar. Despite having once roamed across much of Africa and even parts of Europe and Asia, the world's remaining Lion population now resides in sub-Saharan Africa. However, with Lion numbers thought to have dropped by 30% over the past 20 years these enormous predators are sadly becoming more and more vulnerable in their decreasing natural environment.
